	<p>Hi, my name is Jyothi Prakash. I am a Trainee Web Developer at Madiba Technologies Pvt. Ltd. working on front-end technologies, mostly on AngularJS. I have always been fascinated by technology and especially tools for analysing and interpreting information. I want to use this website to make my profile.</p>

	<p>Before working at Madiba Technologies, I was an undergraduate at Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge Technologies(RGUKT), AP IIIT RK Valley in Kadapa.  Before that, I have finished my 10th at Andhra Pradesh Residential School(APRS), Gorantla in Kurnool.</p>
